# Influence-of-AI-Assistance-Analysis-in-Students-Learning
A data analytics project using Python, R, and Tableau to analyze how AI tools influence student learning patterns, satisfaction, and academic outcomes. The project uncovers insights into AI usage across student levels, disciplines, and task types, and presents findings through interactive dashboards to support educators and policymakers.

Influence of AI Assistance in Student Learning is a comprehensive data analytics project that explores how AI tools impact students across different levels, disciplines, and tasks. The project analyzes how factors such as student level, discipline, session length, number of prompts, task type, AI assistance level, outcomes, and satisfaction ratings influence learning behaviors and academic results.Leveraging Python for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, R for statistical validation, and Tableau for interactive dashboards, the project uncovers valuable insights into AI-assisted learning.Findings highlight that undergraduate students are the main users, coding tasks provide the highest satisfaction and reuse rate, and higher AI assistance levels directly improve satisfaction. Medium-length sessions and interactive prompt usage also show stronger academic outcomes.Through advanced analytics and visual storytelling, the project helps educators, institutions, and policymakers understand how AI shapes modern learning, enabling them to design more effective AI integration strategies.

Objectives
-----------
Identify how AI assistance influences student learning across levels, disciplines, and tasks.
Explore relationships between AI assistance level, task type, and final outcomes.

Validate findings using statistical hypothesis testing (T-test, ANOVA, Z-test, Chi-square, F-test).

Visualize insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard for educators and decision-makers.

Compare patterns in session length, number of prompts, and satisfaction ratings.

Tools & Tecnologies
-----------
Python – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)

R Programming – Statistical hypothesis testing (t.test, aov, chisq.test, Z-test, F-test)
